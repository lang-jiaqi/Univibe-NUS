# UniVibe

**Level of Achievement: Apollo 11**

## 🚀 Motivation

Many NUS students are eager to exercise to relieve academic stress or stay healthy, yet they struggle with maintaining long-term commitment. Existing fitness apps fall short due to:

- ❌ Lack of structured, personalized workout guidance  
- ❌ Absence of a supportive and active community  
- ❌ Difficulty finding suitable workout partners or accessible venues  

## 🌟 Vision

UniVibe aims to build an integrated mobile fitness platform tailored to the NUS community, enabling students and staff to:

- Track fitness progress
- Find workout partners
- Stay inspired through a vibrant community
- Build a long-term fitness habit

Our goal is to create a campus culture that values health alongside academics.
